# Agrobots Website

This project is the public-facing website for Agrobots, a platform that reimagines agriculture through autonomous, regenerative ecosystems. The website showcases the core concepts, vision, and various components of our approach, providing visitors with an engaging and informative experience.

## Overview

The site is built around modular content and dynamic templates, ensuring that each section—whether it's the intro, vision, bioromes, impact, or participation pages—can be easily updated and maintained. Each content file (such as `intro.js`, `landos.js`, `vision.js`, `biorome.js`, `issue.js`, `services.js`, and `participate.js`) contains structured data that drives the user interface, making it simple to adapt or expand the content as the project evolves.

## How It Works

- **Templates and Components:**  
  The website uses various components to render content. For example, the "Connection Circles" component visually represents the process steps (Design, Deployment, Production, Optimization) and uses SVG overlays to draw connecting arrows on desktop layouts. On mobile devices, the layout automatically adjusts to a vertical, list-style presentation to maintain clarity.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Using CSS media queries, the site adapts to different screen sizes. On larger screens, dynamic, positioned elements and interactive arrows guide users through the process. On smaller devices, the content is reformatted into a clear, vertical layout for easier reading and navigation.

- **Content Files:**  
  Each major section of the site is defined in its own content file:
    - `intro.js` – Introduces Agrobots with a video feature and descriptive text.
    - `landos.js` – Explains the Land OS platform using interactive action circles.
    - `vision.js` – Shares our vision for a future where nature and technology work in harmony.
    - `biorome.js` – Details our core concept of Bio-Robotic Modular Ecosystems.
    - `issue.js` – Outlines the challenges of modern agriculture and the need for a regenerative approach.
    - `services.js` – Describes the different applications of our technology (e.g., agricultural automation, brownfield remediation, ecological monitoring).
    - `participate.js` – Provides information on how visitors can get involved, including supporting our Kickstarter, sharing our mission, or partnering with us.

- **Minimal Setup:**  
  This repository is a complete representation of the website's structure and content. There is no need for installation or additional setup beyond deploying the files to your preferred hosting environment.

## Purpose

The Agrobots website is designed to educate, engage, and inspire visitors by clearly communicating:
- Our innovative approach to agriculture and how we integrate advanced technology with regenerative practices.
- The benefits of our system for the environment, local communities, and sustainable food production.
- Ways to get involved with the project—whether by supporting our campaigns, spreading the word, or partnering with us.
